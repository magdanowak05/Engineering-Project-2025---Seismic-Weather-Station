# Engineering-Project-2025---Seismic-Weather-Station
Our project consists of collecting data on the occurrence of earthquakes (and data related to them, such as the time of the shock or weather conditions at the time), and then analyzing them using the STA/LTA algorithm. The project combines elements of algorithms, machine learning and data collection using an Arduino microcontroller.
